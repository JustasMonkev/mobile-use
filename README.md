# Project Setup

### 1. **Create & activate the virtual environment**

```bash
uv venv                # uv reads .python-version ‚Üí uses Python 3.12.2
# macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
# Install project dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# Install dev dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
# Install & link the project
uv pip install -e .
```

### 3. **Set the environment variables, configure LLMs**

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys.

To run the project out-of-the-box, you only need to specify an **OpenAI API key**.
To customize the models used by each agent, copy and edit:

```bash
cp llm.override.template.json llm.override.json
```

Make sure to provide the relevant API key for the provider you want to use.

### 4. **Run the project**

> üí° **Note:** If you did not set a model name and provider in your environment variables, a selection menu will appear to help you choose which one to use for running `mobile-use`.

```bash
python ./src/minitap/main.py "Go in settings, check my current battery level"
```

### 5. **Exit the virtual environment**

```bash
deactivate
```

## Recommended Development VS Code Setup

### 1. **Install the recommended extensions**

This repository includes a list of recommended VS Code extensions in the `.vscode/extensions.json` file. When you open this project in VS Code, you will be prompted to install these extensions. They are highly recommended to ensure a consistent development experience and to take full advantage of the project's tooling (like Ruff).

### 2. **Configure the IDE Python interpreter & Ruff**

Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file and add the following configurations:

ü™ü If you're on Windows, set:

```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe"
}
```

üêß On macOS/Linux, set:

```json
{
  "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python"
}
```

And make sure to add this as well (not platform-specific) so that Ruff formats on save:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": "always",
    "source.fixAll.ruff": "always"
  },
  "ruff.enable": true,
  "ruff.path": ["ruff"]
}
```
